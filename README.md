# Machine_Learning_Class_imbalance
Project based on class imbalance problem solved using different machine learning algorithms.
In this projec, jupyter Notebook is used to run python code.
Download the credit card fraud detection dataset from kaggle.com named it as "creditcard.csv" and paste it in the same folder.
To run the file just open jupyter and run the python file.

This project aimed to address the class imbalance problem in machine learning, where the number of instances in one class is significantly smaller than the number of instances in another class, leading to biased models. The study used different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM etc. 
To tackle the class imbalance problem, the study employed different techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and a combination of both. The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. The study concluded that different machine learning algorithms can be used to tackle the class imbalance problem, and the choice of algorithm and sampling technique should be based on the specific dataset and problem at hand.
